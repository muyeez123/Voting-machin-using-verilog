# Voting-machine-using-verilog
Designing a voting machine for three candidates using Verilog involves creating a digital circuit that can count and display the votes cast for each candidate. Here's a brief overview of how you might approach this:

Inputs:
Three buttons or switches for each candidate to cast a vote.
Clock signal for synchronous operation.
Reset button to reset the vote count.
Outputs:
Three displays or LEDs to show the count for each candidate.
Optional: Display or LED to indicate when the voting process is active.
Logic Design:
Use flip-flops to store the count for each candidate.
Implement logic to increment the count for a candidate when their corresponding button is pressed.
Implement logic to reset the count to zero when the reset button is pressed.
Ensure that only one vote can be cast at a time (debouncing the input).
State Machine (Optional but recommended):
Implement a simple state machine to control the behavior of the system.
States could include idle (waiting for a vote), counting (incrementing the count), and reset.
Display:
Use multiplexing techniques if using multiple displays to show the count for each candidate.
Update the display output whenever the count changes.
Verification:
Simulate the design using a Verilog simulator to ensure correctness.
Test the design with various scenarios, including edge cases.
